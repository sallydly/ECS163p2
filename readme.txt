MILESTONE:
I completed my first visualization (the large overview) with filtering options for each year and I also added tooltips for the bars. I've also laid out a basic plan for all of Project 2. For the connected visualization, I plan to send the user to a different visualization when they click a bar. This next visualization would be more specific in the different positions in each government department. For the (kind of) separate third visualation, I wanted to create a zoomable circle packing visualization (example: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535) that would update every time the user clicked on a bar.
